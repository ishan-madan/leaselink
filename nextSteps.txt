NEED TO DO:

- Add in functionality for all auto user verifications for all api calls 
NOTE: Something about verifyAdmin function is preventing program from switching accounts.
It keepts getting stuck on one account and it will keep thinking it is that account based 
on the token, even when its logged out. verifyToken works perfectly fine when i dont have it 
running on the vandor and property routes. Figure out this issue.

- add in frontend functionality for delete incident, close/open chat etc

- add in functionality for admin website (add vendors, add properties, property dropdowns, vendor dropdowns, see all incidents and chats)

- Also strat fine tuning openAI and figure out if you can have 
it call on the api to get data from the database




POSSIBLY DONE BUT NEEDS TO BE CONFIRMED:

- write method in api communicator to fetch the chat messages from 
the backend upon opening the chat page. Functionality is commented out
on the chat.tsx page. Need to implement an axios call in the api communicator
to the fetchChats route

- Next, i want to figure out how to display the 
incident title on the chat page. I also want to 
figure out a way to pass in this title as a parameter
to the api calls for incidents.

- pass the incident id into axios when passing new chat message 
and then use the incident id passed in to get the incident index 
and then use that to output chat messages through the res



CONFIRMED DONE:
